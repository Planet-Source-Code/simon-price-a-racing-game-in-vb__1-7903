Hover Cars - By Simon Price - Unfinshed Racing Game

About Hover Cars

Hover cars is an unfinished project of mine. It came into existance because I have never seen anyone make a racing game in VB, and I have seen alot of VB games (my website, www.hispalace.fsbusiness.co.uk is full of them). I presumed that this was because the graphics needed to be fast and complex - that's not easy in VB. However, it is possible as this game proves, and with a little more effort such as a lap counter and better crash physics this could be a really good game. If anyone out there wants to finish the game and take joint credit for it then that's OK with me, as long as you send me a copy to put on my website (www.hispalace.fsbusiness.co.uk).

Options

I recommend you keep all the default options, and choose any course that takes your fancy, although I recommend that you choose either 'Mud Maze' or 'Formula 1' to start with. You can turn collision detection on if you want, but don't do it if you have lots of cars on the course! Speaking of which, if you have a OK PC, try racing 20 computer controlled cars with collision detection off. Then you will see that the game is actually pretty efficient, if it can control and draw 20 cars racing around the course at a smooth frame rate.

Controls

Use the left mouse button to accelerate, the right mouse button to brake or reverse and the arrow keys to steer your hovercar. If nothing happens and the other cars zoom off without you, it's probably because the cursor isn't on the form. The P to pause/unpause the game. Press escape to stop play and go back to the main menu.

Course Design

The course design screen was not supposed to be with the game, but I've incuded it so that you can make your own courses when you make your own racing game (although if you do this, my name has to go in your credits page!). Hence it is not easy to use - I designed it for myself to use, and included it at the last moment. What you have to do is select tiles with your mouse and then change the picture on the tile to what you want. When you have got your course looking nice (don't make it too hard - the computer controlled cars won't be able to do it!), double click the preview box and it will change into outline mode. Here you can program the cars to follow the course by selecting each tile and pressing the arrow keys to change the target direction of travel. This is a tricky thing to get right - you can load my courses as examples to learn from because you have to get a good racing line remembering that it is very slippery handling. Just one mis-pointed arrow can mess the whole thing up. Luckily you can save it, test it, then load it back up again to make adjustments.

Known bugs

Loads! Here's just a few for you to fix
1/ The pro car is so fast that it can smash through walls and escape from the level and wonder into the infinite yellowness of nowhere.
2/ The crash physics suck and that is why the collision detecton is turned off by default.
3/ On the course editor, 50% of saves and loads fail first attempt. However, clicking retry usually works.
4/ Many times computer cars crash and are too dumb to get out of it.

Want more help?

There is a full tutorial about how to make raing games on my website explaining how hover cars works. The address is www.hispalace.fsbusiness.co.uk . There are also many other types of games there plus a few graphics programs - all written in VB. You can also email me at KingSimon@HisPalace.fsbusiness.co.uk

Copywrite stuff

All code in this project group is copywrite of Si's Games blah...blah.. basically don't sell it, don't copy it and take credit for it, don't break it up - if you give it to someone give them everyting including this readme file. YOU MAY NOT PUT THIS ON A WEBSITE. However, you may put a link to :               www.hispalace.fsbusiness.co.uk/hovercars

Thankyou for reading all the way to the bottom (are you sure you didn't skip a bit?)
