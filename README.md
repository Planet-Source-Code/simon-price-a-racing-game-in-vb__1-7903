## A Racing Game In VB\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

I've never seen a decent racing game in VB - until now! This

racing game has fast, detailed graphics and good AI. AI? Yes, there are

opponent cars!!! AND there is a course editor so that you can design and

save your own courses - then teach the computer controlled cars to race on

it! Accurate collision detection and smooth handling. If you enjoy or learn

from this game, then a vote in return would take alot less time and effort

than what I put into this game!
